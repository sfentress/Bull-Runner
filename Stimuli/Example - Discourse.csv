Two word, Yes-No and True-False questions can be mixed freely. Reaction times are recorded for everything. Note that the categories are non-continuous. This is just to show that this is possible, and not because it is necessary.",,,,Paragraph type,Question type,,,Easy,,"Once upon a time there was a dear little chicken named Chicken Little.

Topology begins with a consideration of the nature of space, investigating both its fine structure and its global structure. Topology builds on set theory, considering both sets of points and families of sets.<p>The word <i>topology</i> is used both for the area of study, and for a family of sets with certain properties described below. Of particular importance in the study of topology are functions or maps that are continuous. These functions stretch space without tearing it apart or sticking distinct parts together.",,Hard,,"When the discipline was first properly founded, toward the end of the 19th century, it was called geometria situs (Latin geometry of place) and analysis situs (Latin analysis of place). From around 1925 to 1975 it was the most important growth area within mathematics.<p>Topology is a large branch of mathematics which includes many subfields. The most basic division within topology is into point-set topology, which investigates such concepts as compactness, connectedness, and countability, and algebraic topology, which investigates such concepts as homotopy, homology, and knot theory.",,,Hard,Every continuous image of a compact space is compact.,TRUE,,Nasty,"On a paracompact Hausdorff space, is it true that every open cover admits a partition of unity subordinate to the cover?",yes,
